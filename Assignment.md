***CST 466 Prof. N.***

**Assignment#1**

This is a Team Assignment. All teams will be assigned by the end of 1st day of class.

All programs are to be checked off by due date. Check off involves showing and testing program to Prof. N in class or over Zoom (student's choice for PM. Klamath, do NOT drive up to check off in-person. Klamath â€“ check off in Zoom ONLY)

**Assignment Specifications!**

1. (50 Pts) You want to implement the Caesar Cipher by using any language you'd prefer. 
    
	Write a program that will prompt the user for encryption or decryption. 

	***If encryption is chosen:*** 

		- read in a key
		- read in a plaintext file
		- encrypt the plaintext
		- output the result to a ciphertext file (all file names dependent on user). 
		
	***If decryption is chosen:***

		- read in a key
		- read in a ciphertext file
		- decrypt the ciphertext
		- output the result to a plaintext file (all file names dependent on user). 

2. (50 Pts) Write a C++ program that will perform the cryptanalysis of the Caesar Cipher. 

	Namely, given some ciphertext and no key, the program will recover the plaintext. 
	
	***Be careful, you must make an effort to minimize the amount of work required of the user.***
	
	The user should not be required to read 26 different files and pick out the correct plaintext among them. The program should reject as many non-plaintext files as possible. The specification should target the same student in part 1. Like all cryptanalysis, one must make some assumptions based on knowledge of the language. Assume the text is in English and make some good assumptions and include them in the comments of the program!
